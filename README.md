# Tech Launcher ME-CFS-Project

# Overview

Medical centres and clinics collect abundant records on patients that can be applied to health and medical research challenges. This is certainly the case with CFS Discovery in Melbourne, who have collected detailed data on ME/CFS patients for almost 20 years. ME/CFS is a mysterious and controversial disease, where Australian scientists are making excellent progress via cross-disciplinary research.

Patient data is stored as individual records, and as such it is very time consuming to physically extract the data for spreadsheets and databases, required for machine-learning and other analyses.

The project is: To automate the extraction of valuable ME/CFS patient data into aggregated form (via spreadsheets is fine), accurately and efficiently. The successful completion of this challenge will accelerate our research efforts towards understanding ME/CFS, by contributing to the construction of anonymous patient databases for pattern recognition interrogation, as well as in support for future biobanks.

# Project Administration

### Technical Risk
#### Time for the text conversion to be longer than client’s expectation
Likelihood: Unlikely
Consequence: Catastrophic
Priority: high
Solutions: Obtain main stakeholder’s agreement on the time required for conversion to match expectation
#### Limitation of knowledge in handwritten to text conversion
Likelihood: Possible
Consequence: Moderate
Priority: high
Solutions: Obtain main stakeholder’s agreement on the possible removal of feature
#### New record types to be considered apart from existing printed document samples
Likelihood: Certain 
Consequence: Major

Solutions: Obtain main stakeholder’s agreement on working on these records in a future implementation

### Ethical Risk
#### Data security breach
Likelihood: Possible
